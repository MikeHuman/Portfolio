		This art is from a game design class I took during my degree, a 2D sidescroller about a mushroom trying to find</br>
		his mushlings while avoiding dangerous enemies. I intentionally used a hand drawn style to convey a storybook look</br>
		as I was inspired by some books and movies I used to love as a child. I have designed various enemies for the</br>
		mushroom to avoid, as well as displaying how I created the run cycle of the main character.

	<p>This is concept art from my thesis project for my Bachelor's Degree. I was designing a retro style FMV game in a</br>
	surrealist horror genre. I created two character idea sheets for each of the main characters, along with a few final</br>
	outfit designs. I created some ideas for NPCs, enemies, and bosses, as well as a couple of environment concept designs.
